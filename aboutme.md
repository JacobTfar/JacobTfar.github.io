subtitle: What you should know about me
---

My name is Jacob, and if there's one thing you should know—it's that I believe in **strong connections, hard work, and always striving for something greater**. 

- **I rock a great mustache** (seriously, it deserves recognition).  
- **I value my family above all**—they've shaped who I am and why I push forward.  
- **I thrive on problem-solving**, whether it's fixing IT systems, optimizing workflows, or figuring out the best way to build something from scratch.  
- **I've traveled, adapted, and overcome challenges** that have made me who I am today.  

Life is about **growth and purpose**, and I’ve made it my mission to keep learning, helping, and building—whether it's through IT, business, or just lending a hand to those who need it.

What else do you need?

### My story

I'd say I have been shaped by resilience, adaptability, and a relentless drive to grow. I was born in Staten Island, New York, and moved to Ridgefield, NJ in elementary school. Later, I settled in Union, NJ, where I built lifelong friendships, played soccer in Vauxhall, and spent countless hours biking through Maplewood, Roselle Park, and Elizabeth.
During my sophomore year of high school, I moved to Costa Rica, a shift that brought both new experiences and unforeseen challenges. Due to personal circumstances, my family relocated again—spending time with relatives in Colombia before returning to the U.S. When I restarted my sophomore year at Union High School, familiar faces made the transition easier, grounding me in a community I had always valued.
At 18, I began working at UPS as a package handler, determined to move up, help at home, and build a strong foundation for the future. But as life pushed me in new directions, I decided to take on a greater challenge—one that would honor the memory of my father and prove to myself that I could forge my own path. In March 2021, I joined the United States Marine Corps as a Data Systems Administrator, stepping into a role that would broaden my perspective in ways I never expected.
Through the Marine Corps, I made incredible friendships with people from vastly different backgrounds. I’ve traveled to places I never thought I’d see and gained a deep appreciation for the shared struggles of service—though I never saw combat, the emotional toll of leaving loved ones behind is a weight of its own. Despite the challenges, I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything. It shaped me, pushed me beyond my limits, and gave me the discipline to keep moving forward.
Now, I’m channeling that same dedication into IT, business development, and technical problem-solving. I’m helping my stepdad’s family business expand, while deepening my expertise in IT infrastructure, web development, and strategic solutions. My goal is to build Serenity IT, a consulting initiative that reflects my commitment to reliability, clarity, and efficiency in technology.
